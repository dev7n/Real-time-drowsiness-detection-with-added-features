# 💤 Drowsiness Detector

A real-time drowsiness detection system using computer vision techniques. It leverages facial landmarks to analyze eye closure, head pose estimation for nodding off, and ambient brightness for enhanced visibility in low-light conditions.

## 🚀 Features

- Detects eye closure using Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
- Detects head tilt to capture potential drowsiness
- Enhances video feed in low-light environments (night mode)
- Plays an alarm if drowsiness is detected
- Uses `dlib`'s facial landmark predictor and OpenCV for image processing
